# Sparkline

Sparkline lets you create small inline ANSI charts of time series. It supports
two modes: sparkline and chart. The former fits in one line, the latter spans
multiple lines and has labels.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `sparkline` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:sparkline, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
